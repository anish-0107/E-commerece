## 🚀 Key Features

### 🛒 Order Management (Transaction Safe)
- **Atomic Operations:** Uses TypeORM `QueryRunner` to ensure that an order is only created if stock is successfully deducted.
- **Relational Data:** Complex joins between `Orders`, `OrderItems`, and `Products` to show detailed purchase history.

### 🔍 Advanced Search & Filtering
- **RxJS Powered:** Uses `switchMap` to cancel previous searches and `debounceTime` to optimize API calls.
- **Taxonomy System:** Three-tier categorization (Type -> Category -> Sub-Category).

### 📦 Inventory Control
- **Real-time Stock Tracking:** Dedicated "Out of Stock" dashboard with pagination support.
- **Dynamic Updates:** Automatic stock decrementing upon order placement.

### 🔒 Security & Session Management
- **Immediate Lockout:** Real-time user status monitoring; if a user is locked by an admin, the system triggers an immediate logout via RxJS stream monitoring.
- **Session Security:** Implemented robust session handling to manage user authentication states across page refreshes.
- **Auto-Logout logic:** Ensures that unauthorized or inactive sessions are terminated to protect user data.

### 🛒 Persistent Cart Management
- **Database-Synced Cart:** Cart items are stored in the database, allowing users to switch devices (mobile to laptop) without losing their selected products.
- **Cart-to-Order Conversion:** Seamlessly transitions persistent cart items into `OrderItems` upon successful checkout.
